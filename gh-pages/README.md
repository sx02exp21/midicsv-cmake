# midicsv-cmake
Repackaged midicsv project using cmake

## midicsv
[Original project midicsv](http://www.fourmilab.ch/webtools/midicsv/)

Allows processing MIDI file into CSV file and CSV file (in appropriate format) back to MIDI file.

## cmake
Intention is to update and simplify portability for the midicsv utility, initially particularly for
Windows x64 and MSVC, but also to use the flexibility of cmake for generating other build systems and
platforms.

## further development
Possible port to C++ with expanded midi capabilities and further test enhancements.
